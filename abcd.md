## Leaderboard System

### Weightage Balancing System


1. **Assign Weights:**
   - Assign a weight to each difficulty level.
   - These weights reflect the relative difficulty or complexity of each level.

2. **Calculate Weighted Scores:**
   - Multiply the raw score of each participant by the corresponding weight of the difficulty level.
   - This gives you a weighted score for each participant based on the difficulty level they attempted.

3. **Normalize Runtimes:**
   - Normalize the runtime values. You can use a formula to scale the runtimes, so they are on a comparable scale across different difficulty levels. For example, you might divide the runtime by the maximum allowed runtime for each difficulty level.

4. **Calculate Runtime Scores:**
   - Subtract the normalized runtime from a base value (e.g., subtract from 100). The idea is to reward lower runtimes with higher scores.

5. **Combine Scores:**
   - Add the weighted score and the runtime score for each participant to get their total combined score.

6. **Rank Participants:**
   - Rank participants based on their total combined scores. The participant with the highest total combined score will be ranked first, and so on.

### Here's a simplified example:

- Participant A:
  - Basic: 80 points, Runtime: 10 seconds
  - Intermediate: 120 points, Runtime: 15 seconds
  - Advanced: 150 points, Runtime: 20 seconds
  - Weighted Score: (80 * 1) + (120 * 1.5) + (150 * 2) = 560
  - Normalized Runtimes: 10/15/20 seconds
  - Runtime Scores: 100 - 10, 100 - 15, 100 - 20
  - Combined Score: Weighted Score + Sum of Runtime Scores

- Participant B:
  - Basic: 100 points, Runtime: 8 seconds
  - Intermediate: 90 points, Runtime: 12 seconds
  - Advanced: 180 points, Runtime: 18 seconds
  - Calculate Weighted Score as before
  - Normalized Runtimes: 8/12/18 seconds
  - Runtime Scores: 100 - 8, 100 - 12, 100 - 18
  - Combined Score: Weighted Score + Sum of Runtime Scores

## File Naming Conventions

When submitting solutions, follow the suggested naming convention:

```
<your-username>_week<week-number>_challenge.<programming-language-extension>
```

For example: `colddsam_week1_challenge.py`

### Leaderboard Display

The leaderboard is updated weekly, showcasing contributors with the highest total scores. Monthly prizes are awarded to the top 3 contributors.
